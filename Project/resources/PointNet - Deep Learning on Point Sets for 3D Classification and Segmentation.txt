PointNet: Deep Learnin on Point Sets for 3D Classificationa and Segmentation

- Unified architecture for point analysis that directly consumes points, no conversion to volumns/voxels thus respect the points invariance. Applications: object classification, part segmentation, scene semantic parsing. 
- Challenges with points analysis is irregulaity. Convolutional architecture requires
